# Layl shell
Welcome to the Layl shell, a shell and script interperter for Microsoft Windows®

## How to get the executable?

For more or less user-ready iterations of this WIP software, download the executable from the [Releases](https://github.com/winrevive/layl-shell/releases)

For development builds, clone the [dev branch](https://github.com/winrevive/layl-shell/tree/dev) and build it.

## How to use

 - To enter the Shell, just run the executable.
 - To use the interperter, either go to the commandline and start ``layl [path/to/your/filename.lsh]`` or enter the shell and type ``run [path/to/your/filename.lsh]`` (Can take any plaintext file and interpret, file extension doesn't really matter.)
